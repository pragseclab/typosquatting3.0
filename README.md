# Typosquatting 3.0: Characterizing Squatting in Blockchain Naming Systems
Artifacts for our APWG eCrime 2024 paper entitled "Typosquatting 3.0: Characterizing Squatting in Blockchain Naming Systems" [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00352)

This repository contains the data that was used for the purpose of our analysis on BNS typosquatting. The list of Adahandles and Unstoppable Domains can be found in the `adahandles.zip` and `unstoppable-domains.zip` files respectively. The github [repository](https://github.com/pragseclab/ens-dropcatching) for our IMC 2024 paper on Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Dropcatching [[PDF]](https://www.securitee.org/files/ens_domains_imc2024.pdf) contains a dataset of 3.1 million ENS domains and scripts to collect data on ENS domains through the [ENS Subgraph](https://docs.ens.domains/web/subgraph).
